NOTE: This is a group project by Sam Bateman and Justin Cai. 
Attatched is the project code and writeup. 
The project is in a ``Jupyter notebook'', 
a way to show formatted text, math, code, visualizations, and animations in a web page.
There are two ways to view the project. The first way view it on the web with this link (recommended): 
\url{https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jzc/numerical_methods_for_quantum/blob/master/numerical_methods_for_schrodinger_equation.ipynb?flush_cache=true}.
The second way to view the project is to unzip the project files and open the 
\verb|numerical_methods_for_schrodinger_equation.html| 
file in your web browser. This is not recommended as there are video files we didn't attach in 
the zip file, but which exist in the web version.

Explanation of the files in the zip folder

\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|numerical_methods_for_schrodinger_equation.html| - Open this in your browser to view the project 
    \item \verb|numerical_methods_for_schrodinger_equation.ipynb| - Notebook file for the project 
    \item \verb|tise.ipynb|    - Notebook file for TISE part of project 
    \item \verb|tdse.ipynb|  - Notebook file for TDSE part of project 
    \item \verb|tise_code.py| - Other code for TISE part of project 
\end{itemize}

Additionally, all the project files are also located online at 
\url{https://github.com/jzc/numerical_methods_for_quantum}.
